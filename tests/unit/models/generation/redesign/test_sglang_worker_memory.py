"""Tests for SGLangGenerationWorker memory management:
flush_cache, release_memory_occupation, resume_memory_occupation.

Uses a real SGLang server (Qwen3-0.6B), parametrised over two
configurations so the same tests exercise both a single-worker TP=4
setup and a two-worker TP=2 setup:

  • tp4 — 1 worker × TP=4
  • tp2_2workers — 2 workers × TP=2 (the memory tests target worker 0,
    but both workers share the router)

Each test is fully self-contained — it leaves the server in the same
state it found it.

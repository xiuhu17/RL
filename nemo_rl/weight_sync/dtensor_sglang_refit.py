"""Driver-side SGLang refit drivers for the DTensor policy backend.

These run in the driver process, which is synced without a training-backend
extra, so they cannot live beside code that imports ``megatron.bridge`` or
``nemo_automodel`` at module scope. They only drive the ``policy`` and
``policy_generation`` facades.
